## Who am I?

This is **Jedsek**, a high school student from China, who was imprisoned by nihilism and now is looking for the meaning of life.  

> "All gods are dead: now we want the overman to live."

Someone is fighting for dreams, slaying the fears that hold them back, and then just keeping pushing forward-step by steps.  

So, about you...  
Why can't that someone be you?  
**Why can't me?**
