## Who am I?

This is **Jedsek**, a high school student from China, who recognizes the nihilism and meaninglessness of the world, yet still craves that beauty, and thus seeks the gentle spark, moving forward endlessly within their own misguided emptiness.

Someone is fighting for dreams, slaying the fears that hold them back, and then just keeping pushing forward-step by steps.  

So, about you...  
Why can't that someone be you?  
**Why can't me?**
